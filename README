tbmailarchive - Thunderbird extension for external archival of mails

The intention is to be able to archive emails with an external application
outside of thunderbird. The extension does basically the following:

 1. Save the selected msg in a temporary folder in the filesystem in eml format
    (meaning the mail as is)
 2. Call an external application (or wrapper script) from inside thunderbird
    with the temporary filename as parameter

The extension code itself can be found in the ext subfolder. Use it as template
for your own archival solution.

I have not generated a XPI package. If you don't want to generate a XPI
yourself, you can do a developer install of the extension. Just unzip it in a
folder of your choice, e.g.  ~/bin/tbmailarchival. Then activate it in
thunderbird by creating a file called tbmailarchive@georglutz.de in the
directory extension of your profile directory. In tbmailarchive@georglutz.de
you have to write the path of the extension directory.

sample.pl is a sample wrapper script which shows stat information of the
temporary file.

tbmailarchive expects the wrapper script to have a simple command line
interface: Just the file name a single parameter.  The configuration which
external script should be launched is done in the user settings file prefs.js
in thunderbird user profile directory with the settings
"tbmailarchive.cmdLine1" and "tbmailarchive.cmdLine2".

If the wrapper script is directly executable, e.g. like sample.pl under Linux
you can just define "tbmailarchive.cmdLine1" with the path to sample.pl . When
you need to declare a script runtime first e.g. like cscript for the windows
scripting host declare the path to cscript.exe in "tbmailarchive.cmdLine1" and
the path to the script (VBS, JS, whatever) in "tbmailarchive.cmdLine2".

See tb-profiledir_example for a usage example.
